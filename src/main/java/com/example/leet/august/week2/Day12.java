/**
 * Pascal's Triangle II
 * Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.
 *
 * Note that the row index starts from 0.
 *
 * In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: 3
 *      1
 *     1 1
 *    1 2 1
 *   1 3 3 1
 *  1 4 6 4 1
 * 1 5 10 10 5 1
 * Output: [1,3,3,1]
 *
 * Follow up:
 *
 * Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?
